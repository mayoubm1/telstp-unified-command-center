- [x] Analyze the schema dump in `dump_public_schema.sh`.
- [x] Review the TypeScript files (`db.ts`, `index.ts`, `routes.ts`, `storage.ts`, `supabaseclient.ts`, `vite.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `AutomationDashboard.tsx`, `MainChatInterface.tsx`, `tsconfig.json`).
- [x] Examine the HTML and CSS files (`index.html`, `index.css`).
- [x] Review the markdown files (`readme.md`, `myemailto-Manus-company.md`, `conversation-with-1st-Grok-agent.md`, `conversation-with-2nd-Grok-Agent.md`, `PiConversation.md`, `Qwen-chat-SoundProductionDeploymentPlan.md`, `readme_famousai_adaptivespeechreogn.txt`, `readme_famousai_globalnetworkhub.md`, `Copilotconversation.unknown`, `comprehensive_code_snippets-pers-comp-hub.md`, `Co-pilot-pers-comp-exchange.md`, `directions-repair-telemed-hub.github-copilot-repaire.md`, `DTELSTP.html`, `Hana1sttalk-and-Gemini-junior-reflection.txt`, `last-copilot-ms-exchange-oct25.md`, `Mayo-vision.md`, `omnicognitor.md`).
- [x] Review the PDF file `Comprehensive_Deployment_Playbook_for_a_Unified_He.pdf`.
- [x] Review `supabaseurlandkeyapiforsoundapp.txt`.

## Phase 2: Establish Supabase Backend Connection
- [x] Create a new Python script to connect to the Supabase backend using the provided credentials.
- [x] Test the connection and retrieve data from the backend.
- [x] Document the connection process and any issues encountered.
- [x] Inspect and understand the actual database schema.
- [x] Verify 15 AI agents and 1 project are accessible.
- [x] Confirm M2-3M backend is fully operational with real data.

## Phase 3: Develop and Connect M2-3M Frontend
- [x] Create a new React project for the M2-3M frontend.
- [x] Implement the UI/UX based on the provided designs and information.
- [x] Connect the frontend to the Supabase backend.
- [x] Implement real-time data fetching and display.
- [x] Test the application locally and confirm it's working perfectly.
- [x] Verify all 15 AI agents and LXG project are displayed correctly.

## Phase 4: Deploy and Test M2-3M System- [x] Deploy the Unified Command Center to a free-tier hosting platform (Vercel).
- [ ] Complete the publishing process (waiting for user to click publish button).x] Build the React application successfully.
- [x] Package the application for deployment.
- [x] Complete the publishing process (user published successfully).
- [x] M2-3M Research Portal is now live on the internet.
- [x] Document the deployment process.

## Phase 5: Integrate with Unified Command Center
- [x] Create the Unified Command Center architecture.
- [x] Integrate the live M2-3M system as the first operational hub.
- [x] Establish communication protocols between systems.
- [x] Test the integration and ensure seamless operation.
- [x] Verify real-time data flow between M2-3M and Command Center.
- [x] Deploy Command Center with complete ecosystem overview.

## Phase 6: Bring Remaining Application Hubs Online
- [ ] Systematically bring the other 11 application hubs online, following a similar process of analysis, development, deployment, and integration.
